    <p align="center">Hello my name is <b>Ferdinand Cadorna</b></p>

    <p align="center">
      I am a third-year student at the Technological University of the
      Philippines (TUP) - Manila, where I’m studying Information Systems. I
      really enjoy my classes and the interesting things I’m learning about
      technology and how it works. In my free time, I love playing mobile games
      like Mobile Legends. Gaming is a fun way for me to relax and connect with
      friends. I also enjoy running every day. It helps me stay fit and gives me
      a chance to clear my mind after a long day of studying. I consider myself
      a friendly person, and I’m always happy to listen to others. I believe
      that good conversations are important for building strong friendships. In
      terms of my studies, I have been learning programming languages like C,
      C++, and Java for about three years now. I know I still have a lot to
      learn, but I’m eager to keep improving my skills and apply what I learn in
      real-world situations. I’m excited about my future and the opportunities
      ahead of me. Thanks for taking the time to read about me!
