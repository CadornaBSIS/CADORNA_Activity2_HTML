# My Portfolio
## I. Description.
*This portfolio contains my information, previous projects, and the level of my proficiency in programming languages such as C, C++, HTML, and Java. The portfolio consists of four pages: the Homepage, Project Page, Skills Page, and lastly, the Contact Page, which highlights my projects and programming knowledge. This portfolio is built entirely using HTML.*
## II. Instruction to clone repository run the site using VSCode Live Server.
*In order to run the site using VSCode Live Server we must download first the VSCode and Git because via installing that application we can finaly run the site and  clone repositories from version control platforms like GitHub.* 

*Once both are installed, open VSCode and proceed to install the Live Server extension by navigating to the Extensions category in the upper left side of the interface in VSCode, search live server and download it*

*To clone a repository, you can start by using the Git: Clone command from the Command Palette (just hit Ctrl+Shift+P) or by clicking on the Clone Repository button in the Source Control view. If you’re cloning from GitHub, VS Code will ask you to log in to your GitHub account. Once you’re authenticated, you’ll be able to pick a repository from the list to clone onto your machine. If you're working with a different Git provider, simply enter the repository URL, click Clone, and choose a folder on your computer where you want to store the files. After the cloning process is finished, VS Code will automatically open the folder*

*When the Live Server extension is already installed. open the index.html file. Right-click on the file and choose Open with Live Server from the context menu or click the Go live sign in lower right of the VSCode. This action should automatically launch your website in your default browser at the address http://127.0.0.1:5500/.*
